## 1. Problem Statement :
   - **Customers**: Users & maintainers etc.,including & not restricted to Developers, researchers, & creative teams who need a scalable, programmatic text-to-video generation service.
   - **Pain Points**: Current GenAI tools are often single-instance, blocking, & lack scalable API endpoints. Customers require asynchronous, concurrent, multi-GPU processing to handle high request volumes.
   - **Urgency**: Demand for generative AI content is growing rapidly; this solution enables fast iteration & deployment.

[*`back to index`*](https://github.com/keerthanap8898/TextToVideoAPI?tab=readme-ov-file#contents-)

---  

## 2. Proposed Solution :
   ***Goal is to build an asynchronous text-to-video API using the Genmo Mochi-1 model hosted on an 8×H100 GPU Kubernetes worker node. The backend will handle job submission, tracking, & retrieval via JSON-based endpoints. A basic React-based frontend will allow prompt submission, status monitoring, & file downloads. The system will be deployed on Kubernetes (K8s) with GPU resource allocation, multi-replica redundancy, & horizontal scaling.***  
   - **Non-Goals**: This MVP will not include advanced scheduling algorithms, RBAC, LLM-based load estimation, or zero-knowledge security layers - those are reserved for post-MVP.

---  

## 3. Architecture & Components
  - **Core services**
    - **API Gateway / FastAPI**: REST (JSON) endpoints for job submission, status, retrieval  
    - **Orchestrator (Python)**: async job queueing, batching heuristics, retries, DLQ; distributes work to Rust workers  
    - **Workers (Rust)**: encapsulated, short-lived processes; memory-safe; idempotent; deterministic behavior within defined bounds  
    - **GPU Execution**: containerized inference on **H100**; per-pod GPU request/limits  
    - **Artifact Storage**: S3/MinIO for generated video & logs  
    - **Monitoring**: Prometheus exporters + Grafana dashboards; alert rules for SLOs

  - **Data & control flow (high-level)**
    - Client submits prompt → API persists request + enqueues job  
    - Orchestrator schedules to Rust workers (based on GPU availability/heuristics)  
    - Worker executes model inference (Mochi-1), streams progress/metrics  
    - Artifacts stored in S3/MinIO; status updated; client retrieves results

## 4. Success Metrics (The How does one know it worked?)
   
   - **MVP Targets**
      - ≥95% job success; P95 latency ≤10 min; P95 queue wait ≤2 min  
      - ≥4 parallel jobs; ≥99% demo availability; 100% artifact validity

   - **Production Targets (reference)**
      - ≥99.9% availability; P95 ≤6 min / P99 ≤10 min  
      - GPU utilization 70–90%; retries <1%; 0 critical CVEs

[*`back to index`*](https://github.com/keerthanap8898/TextToVideoAPI?tab=readme-ov-file#contents-)

---  

## 5. Research Planning: GPU Cost & Orchestration Analysis
  - The 120-day plan combines **bar costs (best/avg/worst)** with a **parrot-green 5-day rolling mean GPU-hrs/day**. Phase boundaries are shaded softly up to \$15,000.

  - **Observations**
    - Peak load ~128 GPU-hrs/day early in **Multi-GPU** phase  
    - Cost hotspots: **Fault Tolerance**, **Load Testing**, **Final Benchmark**  
    - Later stages taper off; canaries constrain risk/cost
    - Visualization of **GPU usage & cost trends across all phases**.
 
   - ![Research Cost analysis](https://github.com/keerthanap8898/TextToVideoAPI/blob/main/Resources/Other/Images/Text_to_Video_CostAnalysis.png)  

  ```
       - Captures the "best", "average" & "worst" case GPU costs estimated to completely test & prove my hypothesis.  
       - Includes 5-day rolling mean GPU usage line.  
       - Highlights phase peaks at correctness-heavy workloads (Multi-GPU support, Fault Tolerance, Load Testing).  
  ```

## 6. Open Questions and Assumptions

 a. **Considerations & Estimations**:
  - **Load visualization for video length vs prompt length**:
  - Isolines show approximate VRAM contours per sister node (illustrative)
   
 b. **Estimated Runtime vs. Video Duration & Prompt Length**:
  - ![Load+space estimates projected across effort vs video length](https://github.com/keerthanap8898/TextToVideoAPI/blob/main/Resources/Other/Images/video_length_vs_duration.png)
   
 c. **Scale**: Deployment patterns to prevent DoS by region, user-group etc.,with rollback, canary testing, retries, rate-limits etc.
 
 d. **Exceptions**:
 
  - Buggy prompt context from user – poor quality / lack of response
  - Prompt workload exceeds resource allocation thresholds
  - Infra security breaks -> retry & log relevant details
  - Are all tools compatible with potential upgrades & tool integrations without high refactoring costs?
  - Ensure the OOPs aspects optimize computation without logical gaps or duplicate calculations.
      
 e. **Concurrency**:
  - Handled by Python orchestration over encapsulated, asynchronous Rust worker modules that run atomized request threads that close by virtue of Rust’s memory/garbage management semantics that ensure that failed jobs do not break the validity of the session
   
 f. **NP-Completeness & Determinism**:
 
   - **Performance (latency)**: `Scheduling is NP-hard`, handled with heuristics (queues, batching, rate limits); stable statistically, not per run.
   
   - **Correctness (Rust ownership)**: General correctness is undecidable, but Rust enforces memory safety at compile time; `modules behave deterministically`.  
   
   - **Concurrency (async threads)**: `Deadlocks/races are NP-hard`, but bounded with small Rust workers + idempotent tasks; validated with stress/schedule tests.
   
   - **HPC inference**: `Load balancing is NP-hard & is thus, approximated`; with async streaming + job routing; predictable at cluster level via forecasts.  
   
   - **Cross-language orchestration**: `Protocol conformance is NP-hard`, simplified with schemas, versioning, & idempotent IDs that can be retried upon failure, observed &/or tested appropriately for correctness.

  ```
    - I’m thus sharing a complexity-class-inclusion-diagram (attached).
    - It helps visualize how P ⊂ NP, NP-complete, NP-hard, & Undecidable classes map against this project specifically.
  ```
  - **Complexity class landscape (`P`/ `NP`/ `NP-hard`/ `Unclear`) annotated with the calculated placement of system layers in a hybrid Rust + Python orchestration design - { i.e., where each system layer sits in the proposed design. :) }**

  ***`Hence, to summarize`***:  
  - **Assumptions**:
  ```
    - Video length ≤10s for MVP.
    - Resolution ≤768p.
    - API structure is REST-over-JSON.
    - External object storage (S3/MinIO) is available.
  ```
  - **Open Questions**:
  ```
    - Will the control plane ELB DNS be stable for external access? (known to cause costly DoS across regions resulting in downtime & loss)
    - Expected concurrency limits at demo vs production scale?
    - Any constraints on video length/quality &/or time limits from stakeholders?
    - Complex multi-part prompts requiring state management, explicit network hardening (over sandboxing) plus encryption.
  ```

## 7. Feature Prioritization and Risk Analysis
  **Table mapping **minimal correctness-critical features** vs optional research ones.**
  
  - ![Feature Prioritization Table](https://github.com/keerthanap8898/TextToVideoAPI/blob/main/Resources/Other/Images/FeaturePrioritization_RiskAnalysis_Table.png)  
      ```
      Tier 1 (High):
        - Fault tolerance, scheduling, scalability, correctness validation.  
      Tier 2 (Medium):
        - Monitoring, cost/resource management, inference stability.  
      Tier 3 (Low):
        - UI/UX, API versioning, access control, prompt validation.
      ```

## 8. Testing Strategy
  ***The system is designed for reliability & correctness under diverse workloads. Model nondeterminism vs “golden” tests; flaky performance from noisy neighbors. Since text-to-video generation involves GPU scheduling, multi-process execution, & distributed infra, the testing layers span both functional & non-functional validation.***  
Hence, my testing methodology includes:

### **`8.A. Core Functional Testing` :**
    
  ### a. ***Model Nondeterminism vs “Golden” Tests***:
  ```
    - Meant to detect flaky performance caused by noisy neighbors in shared GPU environments.
    - Manage drift in generated outputs. Golden baselines should be reproducible within a tolerance margin.
    - Category: Pre-release & Nightly regression.
  ```
        
  ### b. ***Validation***:  
  ```
    - Check if things are right under expected inputs & conditions. 
    - Category: Pre-release
  ```
        
  ### c. ***Sanity***:  
  ```
    - Ensure wrong or impossible things can’t happen (bad configs, invalid data).  
    - Category: Pre-release & CI/CD blocking
  ```
        
  ### d. ***Unit***:  
  ```
    - Cover as many test cases as possible, including edge cases, corner cases, & outlier scenarios.  
    - Category: Pre-release & Continuous integration
  ```
        
  ### e. ***Integration***:  
  ```
    - Verify cross-tool & cross-module workflows behave correctly.  
    - (e.g., pre-processing → model inference → post-processing → storage).  
    - Category: Pre-release & Continuous integration
  ```
        
  ### f. ***Regression***:  
  ```
    - Ensure that new changes don’t break existing functionality or previously fixed bugs.  
    - Category: Pre-release & Nightly regression
  ```

 ### **`8.B. Advanced / Non-Functional Testing` :**
  
  ### a. ***Load Testing***:  
  ```
    - Simulate heavy usage across multiple GPUs/nodes; measure throughput, latency, & memory pressure at scale.  
    - Category: Pre-release for capacity planning; Canary for production safety  
  ```
        
  ### b. ***Stress Testing***:  
  ```
    - Push system beyond expected limits (e.g., GPU memory exhaustion, burst API calls, long video generations) to observe controlled failures & recovery.  
    - Category: Pre-release only  
  ```
        
  ### c. ***Chaos Testing***:  
  ```
     - Inject faults (GPU preemption, node restarts, throttled APIs, network partitions) to validate resilience, correctness under disruption, & graceful degradation.  
     - Category: Canary (production experiments)  
  ```
        
  ### d. ***Soak Testing***:  
  ```
     - Run long-duration jobs to uncover resource leaks, GPU overheating issues, or slow degradation of performance/quality.  
     - Category: Pre-release (staging clusters)  
  ```
        
  ### e. ***Concurrency & Safety***:  
  ```
     - Explicitly test multi-GPU scheduling, thread/process safety, & race-condition scenarios in distributed pipelines.  
     - Category: Pre-release & CI/CD  
  ```

 ### **`8.C. Test Deployment Strategy` :**
  
  ### a. ***Pre-release (staging)***:  
  ```
        - Unit, validation, sanity, integration, regression, load, soak.  
        - Goal: ensure correctness & performance before shipping.  
  ```
        
  ### b. ***Continuous Integration (CI/CD)***:  
  ```
        - Sanity, unit, integration, concurrency.  
        - Fast, automated feedback loop for every PR/merge.  
  ```
        
  ### c. ***Nightly Regression***:  
  ```
        - Golden tests, regression, validation.  
        - Ensures long-term reproducibility & stability.  
  ```
        
  ### d. ***Canary (production)***:  
  ```
        - Chaos tests, partial-load tests.  
        - Safely run in production with a subset of traffic or limited GPU pool.  
        - Goal: detect real-world issues without full rollout risk.  
  ```

  ### **`8.D. Suggested Tools/Frameworks` :**
  
   a. ***Unit/Regression/Integration*** – `pytest`, `unittest`, `tox`, `pytest-benchmark`  
   b. ***Load/Stress*** – `locust`, `wrk2`, `k6`, `gpu-burn` (CUDA stress testing)  
   c. ***Chaos*** – `chaos-mesh`, `gremlin`, custom fault-injection scripts  
   d. ***Soak/Long-run*** – Kubernetes cron-jobs, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards  
   e. ***Concurrency*** – `pytest-xdist`, `ray`, distributed pipeline simulators  
   f. ***CI/CD*** – GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins pipelines with GPU runners    

  ```
   Together, this layered testing strategy ensures that the **Text-to-Video API** is correct, robust, fault-tolerant, & performant — validated before release, continuously monitored in CI/CD, & safely hardened in production via canaries.
  ```

## 9. Deployment & Operations:

   **`9.A. Kubernetes`** → Key **`kubectl`** commands for RBAC & other global/regional release strategy optimized for cluster resilience &/or network-traffic/load-metrics/schema-status/node-health, etc., specific scaling; i.e., I included hooks for advanced scheduling & cost estimation modules in these aforementioned, NP-complete problems.
   
   - GPU requests/limits per worker; node with **8× H100**  
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (or manual `scale`) for orchestrator/workers  
   - Canary/rollbacks via `kubectl rollout`  
   
   - **Key kubectl references:**
     - a. `rollout` — https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#rollout  
     - b. `set` — https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#set  
     - c. `scale` — https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#scale  
     - d. `autoscale` — https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#autoscale  
     - e. `auth` — https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#auth  

  **`9.B. Rate Limiting`** → FastAPI linked with a Redis-backed limiter; circuit breakers 
  
   - **Stackoverflow Discussion Link**: [stackoverflow & documentation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65491184/ratelimit-in-fastapi#:~:text=In%20order%20to,this%20to%20work) for the caveat explained below.  
   - **`NOTE`**: ***" In order to use fastapi-limiter, as seen in their documentation: You will need a running Redis for this to work. "***  
       - FastAPI doesn't natively support rate-limiting, but it's possible with a few libraries (listed below), but will usually require some sort of database backing (redis, memcached, etc.), although slowapi has a memory fallback in case of no database.
       
   - Reference documentation:
      - a. [fastapi-limiter | vendor reference doc link - PyPI - https://pypi.org/project/fastapi-limiter](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi-limiter/)  
      - b. [Redis reference](https://redis.io/)  
      - c. [***slowapi | vendor reference doc link - PyPI - https://pypi.org/project/slowapi***](https://pypi.org/project/slowapi/)  
         - `slowapi`'s vendor has noted issues with no patches suggesting that the project may be well on its way into being deprecated upstream & is hence, a poor design choice by default.      

[*`back to index`*](https://github.com/keerthanap8898/TextToVideoAPI?tab=readme-ov-file#contents-)

---  

## 10. Corner Cases & Risk Control:

  1. **Pre-signed URL misuse / token skew / role changes mid-job** → recover state from storage, retry with alerts  

  2. **Hot-keying / DLQ loops / retry storms** → **FastAPI**: use `fastapi-limiter` / `slowapi` (requires Redis; slowapi has memory fallback)  

  3. **Starvation of long jobs; convoy effects; head-of-line blocking.** → long-task handler, estimator + accuracy dashboards & SEV thresholds  
     - dedicated **`long-task exception handler`** node with **`critical Alarm`** if task still fails;  
     - some job length estimator module returning Boolean value paired with a dashboard tracking accuracy trends for the query – *`“is this potentially a long task based on context, linguistics, user/env metrics? Yes/No”`*  
     - Alarms at **Sev-2.5** if accuracy (true positives & negatives) consistently falls over time (i.e., false-value count is increasing. Check load-estimator logic), alarm at **Sev-2** if it falls immediately.  
     
  4. **Log PII, high-cardinality labels; sampling hiding tail latency.** → structured logging & sampling controls; audit for adversarial outliers  
     - Must detect outliers & adversarial samples.  
     - Check if data corruption occurred via access/edit-logs, stack-trace, etc., to ensure no security exploitation broke the ML model.  
     
  5. **Kubernetes deployment Policies & Cluster-platform maintenance** → explicit rollout/canary strategies with health metrics gates  
     - with split-brain deploys across regions; partial rollbacks.
